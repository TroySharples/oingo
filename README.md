# Oingo

A self-taught second attempt at a simple CPU ray tracer (first attempt being the original [Ray Tracing](https://github.com/TroySharples/ray_tracing) project). This is built around the Embree library for general ray tracing, and uses Eigen for vector maths. The goal is to extend this to a full PBRT (Physically Based Ray Tracing) implementation.
